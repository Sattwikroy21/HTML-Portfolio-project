  Hi viewers, I'm Sattwik Roy, a final year student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneshwar.
  I am a tech enhusiast, I've worked on Data Science projects as well as Development projects. My latest works display
  the "Movie-ranking" website and the "Birthday-invite" website. These two projects are purely built on HTML only.
  In the recent times I've developed keen interest in Web and Android Develeopment.
</p>

<p>
  I had studied the very basics of HTML and CSS during my final years in School. But for the past 6 months I have learned new skills,
  the MERN Stack, Django & python, Kotlin and Jetbrains. I am looking forward to try and experiment all the skills I acquired into some new Development
  projects to build better and more catchy Websites or Apps.
</p>

<p>
  I also have keen interest in sports, I have represeented my University in the All-India Inter University Tournament, 
  for the "50m - Freestyle" and "50m - Breaststroke" event in Swimming. I also play Chess and and run marathons as part of my hobby.
</p>

<p>
  I am  open to take up projects and showcase my skills to bring your ideas into reality. Feel free to contact me through the details 
  provided in the "Contact Me" section. Would love to hear from you and see you soon.
